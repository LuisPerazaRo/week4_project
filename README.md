## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Week 4 project
### Getting and Cleaning data in R

The dataset used in this project was first published by Anguita et al. (2012) [1] and can be downloaded in original format from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

This repository contains 1) the CodeBook.md file describing the variables for the datasets, 2) the tiddy datasets for the merged files (test and train datasets) and the averaged results per participant, and 3) the run_analysis.R file that does all needed transformations for this project.
